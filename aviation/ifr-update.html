                I've completed my first listen of IFR ground school, and I
                now have
                a few IFR flights under my belt. I did a couple of flights
                in a six
                pack aircraft, and another couple in a G1000.
            </p>
            <p>
                No matter how much I tried to like the six pack over the
                G1000, I
                can't deny that the G1000 simply offers much stronger
                situational awareness, and my flying is more precise.

            <h2>What I've Learned So Far</h2>
            <p><b>Known Power Settings</b></p>
            <p>
                
                The first and most important thing I've done to improve my
                instrument flying is to print the following table 
                
                <label for="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="mn-figure-1" class="margin-toggle" />
                <span class="marginnote"><img src="/static/power-pitch.jpg" alt="Image of a Rhinoceros" />
                    Power and Pitch for Desired State for a Cessna 172. Sourced from <a
                        href="https://midwestflyer.com/?p=13047">MidwestFlyer.com</a>

                </span>
and put it on
                my aircraft's yoke mount. For any given state in IFR flight, it
                gives me quick pitch and power setting I can use to approximate
                the state I need.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using known power settings, I'm able to shift my focus to managing the aircraft and
                interfacing with the IFR system instead of trying to get my trim just right. I'm still pretty
                low hour in C172's, so this may be less valuable for pilots who did their PPL training in the
                same aircraft they're learning IFR.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>WIRE</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                WIRE is an acronym to guide pilots when preparing for an upcoming IFR approach. It should be completed
                as early as is reasonably possible.
                It stands for
            <ul>
                <li>W: Weather
                    <label for="mn-figure-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                    <span class="sidenote">I can't always receive weather when I'm starting my WIRE briefing. If that's
                        the
                        case, I just do weather at the end (IREW).</span>
                </li>
                <li>I: Instruments</li>
                <li>R: Radios</li>
                <li>E: En-Route Briefing</li>
            </ul>
            <input type="checkbox" id="mn-figure-3" class="margin-toggle" />

            <p><b>Staying Busy</b></p>
            <p>Or, Idle hands are the devil's playground.</p>
            <p><b>G1000 Reference Altitudes</b></p>
            <p>
                For Non-Precision Approaches, you may not descend below the Minimum Descent Alittude, but on Precision Approaches you may descend
                below the Decision Altitude briefly to assess if a landing can be made.
                <label for="sn-demo-alt" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">
                </label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="sn-demo-alt" class="margin-toggle" />
                <span class="sidenote"><a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.175">§ 91.175(c) Takeoff and
                        landing under IFR</a> states that "no pilot may ... continue an approach below the authorized
                    DA/DH unless" the pilot has determined that a landing can be safely achieved. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Given this, it makes sense to set different values in the G1000's reference alittude for the appraoches.
                For a non-precision approach, I was instructed to set the refernce altitude 50 feet above the actual MDA.
                For a precision approach, I program the DA as the reference altitude.
