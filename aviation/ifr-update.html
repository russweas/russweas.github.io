                    I've completed my first listen of IFR ground school, and I
                    now have
                    a few IFR flights under my belt. I did a couple of flights
                    in a six
                    pack aircraft, and a couple in a G1000.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No matter how much I tried to like the six pack over the
                    G1000, I
                    can't deny that the G1000 simply offers much stronger
                    situational awareness
                    and
                </p>
