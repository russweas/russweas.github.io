                <p>
                    I’m starting this blog to journal my IFR training, and as a
                    way of keeping track of my progress in my
                    aviation journey.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My strategy for IFR is to first complete all ground school
                    segments related to the practical aspects of
                    IFR
                    flight. As of today (April 13th, 2024), I have mostly
                    completed the Sporty’s IFR Ground School segments
                    related to En Route Navigation, IFR Departures, and IFR
                    Approaches. I plan to fully complete this
                    portion of
                    ground school this month, then progress to Weather, FAR
                    Regulations, and then build upon that knowledge
                    to
                    prepare myself for the IFR written examination.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One thing that I decided when starting my IFR journey is
                    that I would like to learn how to fly without
                    GPS
                    before transitioning to a Slant Golf or Technically Advanced
                    aircraft. I’m unsure if this is the most
                    cost-effective strategy, but I hope that it will force me to
                    learn the fundamentals without using modern
                    technology as a crutch. Ideally, this should build stronger
                    situational and spatial awareness in the
                    sky,
                    even after I transition to fly GPS after I receive my
                    instrument rating.

                <h2>First Sim Flight</h2>

                <p>
                    For my first sim flight, I flew out of Paso Robles (KPRB) in
                    non-precision approach conditions in my

                    instructor’s home X-Plane simulator. I practiced the
                    following skills in the lesson:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>flying the KPRB ODP for Runway 13</li>

                    <li>intercepting VOR radials</li>

                    <li>modifying course to comply with Radar Vectors</li>

                    <li>intercepting a DME Arc (0.5 nm before, using the 0.5 *
                        10% of ground track rule)</li>

                    <li>tracking a DME Arc</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            using the 10-10 rule, where I add 10 to the OBS when
                            turning right, then turn right 10 degrees until
                            I intercept the next radial. This rule is inverted
                            for left turns.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            using the G1000’s bearing pointer, where I aligned
                            the bearing pointer with the right/left side
                            of the HSI every 10 degrees.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>
                        diving and driving using the vertical navigation panel
                        of the approach plate. For this technique, I
                        descended at about ~1900 RPM / 600 fpm.
                    </li>

                    <li>executing a missed approach at MDA</li>

                </ul>

                <p>
                    I also practiced flying Manhattan Regional’s (KMHK) DME Arc
                    Approach, where I practiced the following
                    additional skills:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>briefing an approach plate</li>
                    <li>briefing an ODP</li>
                    <li>operating with a VOR for DME, a secondary VOR for radial
                        interception, and a localizer</li>
                    <li>intercepting a glideslope for an ILS approach</li>
                    <li>executing a missed approach at DA</li>
                </ul>
